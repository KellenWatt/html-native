# html-native-rails
A Rails adaptation of html-native for use as a template handler. Just treat the file 
like you normally would as template file, but using the html-native DSL, and give 
the file the ".html.rbh" extension. Et voil√†, you have a working template! You even 
have access to all those great Rails helper methods that you normally do.
